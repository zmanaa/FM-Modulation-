# FM-Modulation

This project is done in partial satisfaction of CIE337 - Communications Theory and Systems - total course grade, SPRG21, Zewail City.


Different frequency modulation -__**FM**__- schemes using:
1. MATLAB script file __**.m**__
2. self-implemented simulink model.
3. FM module in simulink.

# Usefull insights
1. The file "main.m" is the file in which all modules are excuted.
2. it's preferable to run the entire main.m file rather than running separate sections in order to work correctly.
3. the "main.m" file is calling scripts for each part written in different scripts.
